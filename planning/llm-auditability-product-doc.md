# LLM Output Auditability Service - Product Document

## Product Overview

The LLM Output Auditability Service provides continuous monitoring and quality assessment of content generated by Large Language Models within the AI News Processor. This service enables us to track performance over time, identify quality issues early, and make data-driven improvements to our LLM outputs.

## Why We Need This

Our AI News Processor generates summaries and content using LLMs, but we currently lack visibility into:
- How output quality varies over time
- Whether specific personas consistently perform better or worse
- Early warning signs of quality degradation
- Data-backed evidence for when to adjust prompts or models

This service addresses these gaps by creating a structured approach to auditing LLM outputs, making quality measurable and actionable.

## Core Functionality

1. **Data Collection**
   - Capture LLM inputs, outputs, and reference texts
   - Record contextual metadata (timestamp, model version, persona identifier)
   - Collect benchmark data from each AI News Processor run

2. **Quality Assessment**
   - Calculate quality metrics for each output
   - Track metrics over time for trend analysis
   - Compare performance across different personas

3. **Reporting & Analysis**
   - Visualize quality trends
   - Alert on significant quality changes
   - Provide actionable insights for improvements

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture Components

1. **Data Ingestion API**
   - Endpoint for AI News Processor to submit outputs and metadata
   - Validation logic for incoming data
   - Authentication and rate limiting

2. **Data Storage**
   - Time-series database for tracking metrics over time
   - Document storage for full LLM inputs/outputs and reference texts
   - Indexing for efficient querying by persona and time period

3. **Quality Calculation Engine**
   - Asynchronous processing of new entries
   - Storage of calculated metrics with links to original content
   - Uses existing LLM-based judge system (already exists in early form)

4. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Visual representation of quality trends
   - Filtering by persona, time period, and metrics
   - Export capabilities for deeper analysis

### Integration Points

1. **AI News Processor**
   - API client to submit data after processing runs
   - Inclusion of necessary metadata with each submission

2. **Existing Benchmark Tool**
   - Adaptation of current benchmarking logic
   - Potential refactoring for reuse within this service

## Overall Tasks

### Core Infrastructure
- Implement data ingestion API
- Set up data storage
- AI News Processor connects to data ingestion API
- Basic quality calculation integration
- Simple dashboard

### Enhanced Analytics
- Extended quality metrics
- Comparative analysis features
- Trend visualization improvements

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed technical specifications for each component
2. Prioritize features for Phase 1 implementation
3. Establish integration plan with AI News Processor team
4. Define specific quality metrics and calculation methods
5. Design initial dashboard mockups
